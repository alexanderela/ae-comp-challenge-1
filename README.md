# Static Comp Challenge 1

This static comp challenge asked for a recreation of a provided comp.
Images of this provided comp and my finished comp can be found in the directory, "Comp_Images".

For my comp challenge, I chose to create a site featuring the Portugues soccer/football star, Cristiano Ronaldo. 
Despite being widely considered one of the best players in the world, Cristiano is not known for his humility, as is evidenced in the comp's header, which features one of the man's actual quotes.

Nevertheless, this site is a celebration of his life and career. The icons in each square are placed to give information about each of his most interesting pieces of relevant information.
If the icons in the site contained real links, they would link to information concerning Cristiano's childhood in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, a rundown of his various trophies, and details about his Italian club, Juventus.

I sincerely hope you enjoy this small tribute to one of the best footballers in the world.
